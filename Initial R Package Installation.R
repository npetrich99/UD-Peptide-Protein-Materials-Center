
# Initial R Package Installation

# Code written by Nolan Petrich

# The "CD Temperature and Wavelength Scan Data Analysis" R script provides 
# general instructions for running the data analysis. However, users will 
# encounter an error when running the code for the first time if they haven't 
# used R before. R uses libraries of code for different tasks. Because of this, 
# these packages often need to be installed. This must be done the first time 
# before running the automated code. Therefore, this file should be run once, 
# the first time a user downloads R, to prepare the system for using the 
# different packages needed to run the automated data analysis file.

# REMINDER: This only needs to be run once.

# Installing Required Packages:
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("scales")
install.packages("extrafont")
install.packages("ggstar")
